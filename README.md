Media Search is a simulation of the iTunes/ Apple Store. The purpose of this site is to allow users to search for music or apps using the iTunes API. The user can search a song, they are given information about the song, and they can preview the song. In addition, the same can be done with apps which connects to the iTunes app store. The user can add both types of media to a playlist. From there, the user can choose to purchase the media which would then reroute them to the iTunes website to purchase the selected media. <br />
